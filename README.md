Linear Regression with SGD to predict the vehicle performance
A much smaller group is putting in place incentives and key performance indicators
(KPIs) to use more ML and automation. Closing the gap requires a stronger commitment
to developing ML capability that is not just useful but also used.

● Exploratory data analysis
● Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
● Training linear regression model with SGD for prediction

I have built two model 
1. Linear regression using OLS
2. Linear regression with Stochastic gradient descent 

In my project accuracy measures for the OLS is better than SGD.
